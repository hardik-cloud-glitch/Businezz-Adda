        Debate Guidelines for "Introduction to the Business"</h1>
    <h2 class="hd1">  Under the Introduction to the Business section, each participant will represent a reputed company and debate on the following topics:    </h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>What's the business about?</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>Participants will present an overview of their assigned company, focusing on its core industry, products, and services.
            </p>
            <p>They will need to explain the company’s mission, values, and its position in the global market.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Brief introduction to the business:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>Students will provide a more detailed introduction, covering the company’s history, evolution, and key milestones.</p>
            <p>They will discuss how the company differentiates itself from competitors, and what makes it unique in its field.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bases of the business:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>Participants will debate on the foundational elements of the business—its operational model, revenue streams, and strategic priorities.</p>
            <p>They will highlight how the company innovates, adapts to market changes, and sustains growth.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Branches (If present):</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>If the company has multiple branches or divisions, participants will describe them.
            </p>
            <p>They should focus on how each branch contributes to the overall success of the business, whether through product diversification, international expansion, or specialized services.</p>
        </ul>
    </ul>
