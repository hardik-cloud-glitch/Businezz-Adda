    <p>The Business Attack committee adds a competitive edge by allowing teams to directly challenge each other during the debates. Each team is given the opportunity to ask one strategic question to another team during the session.</p>

        <h2 id="yhd">Responsibilities:</h2>
        <li>Strategic Questioning: Teams must carefully craft a single, impactful question aimed at exposing weaknesses, challenging strategies, or testing the knowledge of their competitors.</li>
        <li>Critical Thinking: The goal is to ask a question that puts the opposing team on the spot, pushing them to defend their business model or strategies effectively.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="yhd">Impact:</h2>
    <p>The Business Attack committee encourages a more dynamic interaction between teams, fostering critical thinking and sharpening the competitive nature of the debate.
